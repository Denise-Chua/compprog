## Description
This is a repository that contains my solutions to problems from Codeforces, AtCoder, oj.uz, etc., which are all prominent competitive programming platforms. Accepted problem submissions are categorized by folders that correspond to a platform and rating/year.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to show my accepted competitive programming problem submissions categorized by rating for Codeforces and AtCoder, and year for oj.uz. Over time, I aim to expand this collection in order to demonstrate gradual improvement in solving harder competitive programming problems. This will also serve as a reference for solutions to problems I've previously solved, where I can revisit problem-solving strategies.

## Technical Skills
* **Languages**: C++
* **Topics**: Greedy Algorithms, Sorting/Searching, Graph Theory, Dynamic Programming
* **Tools**: Git, GitHub, Visual Studio Code
